# Hello! Welcome to my new place for putting Things.
This blog is where I will share my projects, thoughts, and anything else I feel like.

There isn't going to be a set schedule or anything, I'll just post whenever I feel like it. My hope is that this blog will get me to finish projects that I otherwise would have left unfinished, and will serve as an archive showing all the things I've done. I might write posts about the projects I've already started, or I might not. It depends on what feels worth sharing. I'm quite new to the prospect of writing about everything I do, so it will certainly take a bit of learning. Perhaps this blog will encourage me to do new things just so I can write about them. Time will tell! 

There is both an [rss](/rss.xml) and an [atom](/atom.xml) feed available for you to subscribe to, and it would certainly mean a lot to me if you did! Knowing that people are interested in the things I do pushes me to continue doing them.

I'll leave this post at that. I may talk about some more blog-related things in the near future, but I think that about sums it up for now.

Here's a picture of my cat Misty to fill the space (she says hello):
